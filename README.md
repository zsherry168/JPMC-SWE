# JPMorgan Chase Software Engineering Virtual Experience

This repository contains material from JPMorgan Chase's Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program on Forage. I discovered this opportunity while exploring the company's career page for Software Engineering Internships. Below are some things I learned that I found interesting. 

* **Patch**: I have only retrieved changes, modifications, and additions from a repository through *git pull* or *git fetch*. However, another way to have these new changes on your local machine is through a patch, which is a text file consisting of a list of differences between the original and modified file. To get the changes from the patch, one would need to call *git apply*. 

* **Perspective**: Perspective is an open-source software, written in C++, developed and maintained by JPMorgan Chase with FINOS that provides interactive analytics and data visualization for large and/or streaming datasets. I found it fascinating that an application can handle such large amounts of data quickly and continuously from a computational and visual standpoint. 

* **TypeScript**: I never heard of the programming language TypeScript until now, but through this program, I got to work with some .ts files as well as .tsx files. From my understanding, TypeScript can understand all JavaScript syntax and capabilities while providing additional features. TypeScript's primary value over JavaScript is that it's a statically typed language.
